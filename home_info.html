<p>We provide a set of tools to calculate <strong>photoionization</strong>, <strong>photodissociation</strong>, and <strong>photodissociative</strong>
ionization rate coefficients and the associated photon energy-weighted excess energies of the various photo products. </p>



<p>The program is based on two earlier publications: <a target="_blank" href="pdf/SolarPhotoRatesCoefficients.pdf">Solar Photo Rate Coefficients</a> (Huebner and Carpenter, 1979) 
and <a target="_blank" href="pdf/SolarPhotoRates.pdf">Solar Photo Rates for Planetary Atmospheres and Atmospheric Pollutants</a> (Huebner et al., 1992).</p>






<p>It considers photo fluxes for any activity of the Sun and blackbody photon fluxes for temperatures from about 100 K up to about 1 million K.
The database contains cross sections for <em>38 atomic neutrals</em>, <em>30 atomic ions</em>, <em>16 diatomic</em> molecules, <em>19 triatomic</em> molecules, <em>14 tetratomic</em> molecules, <em>11 pentatomic</em> molecules, and <em>12 suprapentatomic</em> molecules.</p>

<p>References are provided for the cross sections and branching ratios for the total cross sections, thresholds and branching ratios for ionization, dissociation, and dissociative ionization.</p>
