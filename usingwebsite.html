<h1 class="entry-title">Using the Website</h1>
<p>The user specifies the photon source:
The Sun with solar a
given solar activity or a blackbody with a given temperature in Kelvin.
The
Cross sections, binned rate coefficients, and binned excess energies
for
various branches of dissociation, ionization, and dissociative
ionization can
be plotted and down loaded. The database also displays a quality index
for the
reliability of various aspects of the data such as the branching
ratios,
thresholds, etc. In a few cases experimental and theoretical data are
described
and used separately.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title">Using the Database</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select one of the orange tabs along the top to pick the rate
coefficient to be computed.</li>
  <li>Plot options can then be selected that correspond to the
computation of the specific rate, the appearance of the graphs, and
which plots will be made.</li>
  <li>Pick one of the categories from the top yellow tabs where available species are listed according to their number of atoms
or the type of charge.</li>
  <li>The list will expand allowing selection of a specific
atomic, ionic, or molecular species.</li>
</ol>
<p>After clicking the species, a subsidiary window will appear
below with plots as well as a way to download the data used to create the
plots.</p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">The database is based on
the W3C
(World Wide Web Consortium)
standards with cascading style sheets (CSS). By using these standards,
users of
the website from all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix, etc.) experience
superior
browsing and will encounter no degradation of performance as new data
are being
added in the future.</span>
